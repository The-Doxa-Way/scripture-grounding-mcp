# kg-save-gate.sh — PreToolUse(Bash) hook for scripture-grounding-mcp.
# Ported from doxa-cns/openclaw (Garth 2026-07-16 landing-gates suite).
#
# Garth's standing rule: "kg-save on every chunk." This hook is the ENFORCEMENT
# for that rule so it never depends on the model remembering — it survives
# fresh cron/headless sessions.
#
# It gates the chunk-LANDING commands (git push / gh pr create / gh pr merge):
# if the work about to land on main (origin/main..HEAD) contains no change to
# .knowledge-graph/, the landing is blocked with guidance to run kg-save first.
#
# Design choices:
#   * Gates at landing, not per micro-commit — review fix commits would
#     otherwise spam reminders. The real failure is a chunk hitting main with
#     no KG record.
#   * FAIL-OPEN. Any uncertainty (no payload, no jq, no origin/main, not a git
#     repo) -> exit 0 (allow). A buggy hook must never wedge an autonomous
#     build. Only a *confirmed* "landing command + zero KG change" blocks.
#   * Escape hatch: the literal token [skip-kg] anywhere in the command
#     bypasses (for the rare push that is genuinely not a chunk landing).
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code hook contract): 0 = allow, 2 = block (stderr shown
# to the model), anything else = non-blocking error (tool still proceeds).

  # unconditionally, before EVERY exit-0 path below in this MCP-merge branch —
  # this branch's own "PR diff already has a .knowledge-graph/ change" fast
  # path further down would otherwise let a merge through without the check
  # ever running, because this branch returns long before the Bash-command
  # flow's copy of this same check (further down the file) is ever reached —
  # an MCP-tool merge never extracts .tool_input.command at all, so a check
  # placed only in that later flow is a complete blind spot for this one. This
  # inspects the LOCAL checkout's git range (merge-base(origin/main, HEAD)..HEAD)
  # via `git -C`, independent of the remote PR-diff check below — it protects
  # any session that resolved a conflict in THIS checkout, whether it then
  # lands via the GitHub MCP merge tool, `gh pr merge`, or `git push`. A merge
  # landed with no local involvement (GitHub web UI, a bot with no checkout)
  # has nothing local to check and is out of this hook's reach by
  # construction. Fail-open on any tooling trouble.
