/**
 * check-kg-merge-integrity.js — zero-LLM detector for the merkle-observation
 * data-loss class (Garth 2026-08-13: "this should be standing doctrine and
 * practice across all repos").
 *
 * Real incident: PR #343 (doxa-cns) fixed a real bug, but its KG entity was
 * silently lost when a merge conflict on .knowledge-graph-merkle.json was
 * resolved with `git checkout --theirs` — the branch's own observation was
 * discarded with no error anywhere, because the observations array is an
 * APPEND LOG and picking one side can only ever keep a subset. See
 * mergeResolve() in knowledge-graph-merkle.cjs for the correct fix
 * (hash-keyed union of both sides).
 *
 * A naive count comparison (merged >= max(parent counts)) is NOT enough to
 * catch this: in the real incident, the branch's tip and origin/main's tip
 * both happened to hold 970 observations (the branch had gained its own
 * fix's entity; main had independently gained a different PR's entity in
 * the meantime) — so `git checkout --theirs` produced a merge result whose
 * COUNT never dropped below either parent, while still silently discarding
 * the branch's specific entity. This script instead compares observation
 * HASH SETS: a correct union's hash set must equal parent1's hashes UNION
 * parent2's hashes, exactly. Any hash present in a parent but absent from
 * the merge result is a confirmed, named data-loss violation — no count
 * coincidence can hide it.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-kg-merge-integrity.js <base-ref> [<head-ref>]
 *   head-ref defaults to HEAD.
 * Exit 0: no violation (including "no merge commits in range" / "file never
 *   touched" — this check only fires on a CONFIRMED drop, matching the
 *   fail-open philosophy of every other gate in this fleet).
 * Exit 1: a violation was found; details printed to stderr.
