# attest-review.sh — record that an independent review pass ran on HEAD.
#
# Part of the landing-gates suite (Garth 2026-07-16, ported from doxa-cns):
# .claude/hooks/review-gate.sh blocks scripture-grounding-mcp PR merges with
# no attestation for a local branch tip, and .claude/hooks/test-gate.sh
# accepts "waived-tests:" entries from the same ledger. Run this AFTER the
# independent review pass (PR bot / /code-review by a non-author session) +
# fix round:
#
#   scripts/attest-review.sh "clean"                        # no findings left
#   scripts/attest-review.sh "findings-fixed: 2 LOW"        # fixed same round
#   scripts/attest-review.sh "waived: generated-state only" # review waiver
#   scripts/attest-review.sh "waived-tests: <reason>"       # test-gate waiver
#
# The ledger lives in the repo's .git dir (survives within a clone, never
# committed, never churns the tree). This is PROCESS enforcement — it makes
# forgetting the review pass impossible, it does not make the attestation
# adversarially trustworthy (the reviewer writes it). Waivers are the escape
# hatch and they are logged, so a bypass is always visible after the fact.
